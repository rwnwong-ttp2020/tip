The following **required** functionality is complete:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* [ ] Didn't know how to maneuver around XCode panels/sections, so lost my views and buttons frequently. I found some YouTube videos that were helpful.
* [ ] When I made errors following the directions, I didn't know how to troubleshoot them, so ended up deleting and starting over three times.
* [ ] The video showed how to use Recordit.co, but I got a "rate limit exceeded" error when trying to download that app and couldn't figure out how to fix it. Cockos.com is an unsecure site so I didn't feel comfortable with it. I used Quicktime.
